# AdventOfCode2022_kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [skarlman][github] from CompetitiveCoders.com

This year I'm taking my first steps in Kotlin, because you know, why not!?


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
